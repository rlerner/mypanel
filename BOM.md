# Bill of Materials
*This is specific to my system, you may have more or less zones or not want internet connectivity. That's cool, modify as needed*

## Required
 - Arduino Mega 2560 or equivalent
 - Arduino Ethernet Shield 2 (Note this doesn't support HTTPS (TLS/SSL) so plan accordingly
 - Piezoelectric speaker
 - Several jumper pin wires you can strip to interface with a terminal bar
 - Terminal bar(s)
   - Easy math: Zones + 2 -- for Common (GND) and Siren (+)
 - Long USB cable -- long enough to get from power to your panel, or if your panel has power, whatever USB you want
 - Long Ethernet cable, same as above

## Optional
 - Breadboards -- good for debugging or prototyping
 - 3D printer -- good for everyhting in the "objects" folder, like mounts for the microcontroller, tie-downs, and chirper panel
