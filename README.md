# Open Home Security Panel

I hope you find this useful. I'm not a physical security "integrator", but I did work for one. I'm not an electrical engineer, but I know a few. My microcontroller and circuit development experience is probably less than you'd think.

Like everybody, I'm Bobby Securityseed, planting my crooked trees for others to enjoy the fruits of.
