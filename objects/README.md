| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :------ |
| AT Mega Wall Mount.stl | Use it to mount the Mega 2650 on the wall safely without shorting to the original alarm case |
| Cable Tie Hold Downs.stl | Print up your own cable tie hold downs if you're too cheap, like me, to buy them |
| Piezo Alarm Plate.stl | Mount the chriper on the wall. My wall had a big ass hole in it, so I needed a big plate |
